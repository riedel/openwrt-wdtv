#
# Sample driver-specific (Sigma Designs) DirectFB configuration file
#
# The default values built in the Sigma Designs DirectFB driver are appropriate for a bare-bone
# system based on the corresponding Sigma Designs SOC.
#
# This file can be used to customize the configuration for a specific system implementation
# and/or application based on the corresponding Sigma Designs SOC.
#
# To enable the driver-specific configuration in this file, refer this file in the "driver-options" entry of
# the generic DirectFB configuration file 'directfbrc'. Since it must be a fully qualified file name,
# it is recommended to copy this file in the root directory of the DCC-HD SDK package, which is pointed to
# by the DFB_CONFIG_DIR run-time environment variable.
#


# See the "DCC-HD DirectFB Driver Specification" document in the DCC-HD SDK for configuration options.
